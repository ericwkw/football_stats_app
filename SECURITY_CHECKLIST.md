## ðŸ”„ Tasks You Need To Complete

1. **Rotate Your Supabase API Keys**
   - Follow the instructions in `rotate_supabase_keys.md`
   - Update your local `.env.local` file with the new keys
   - Update any deployed applications with the new keys

2. **Clean Git History**
   - Run `./git_filter_secrets.sh` to clean sensitive data from git history
   - This is crucial as your old commits may still contain sensitive information
   - Note: This will rewrite your git history

3. **Final Security Verification**
   - Verify application works with new API keys
   - Run a final scan for sensitive data: `grep -r --include="*.{js,ts,tsx,md,sql,json,yaml,yml}" "supabase.*key\|username:password\|eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI" --exclude-dir=node_modules .`
   - Ensure no API keys or credentials are present in your code

4. **Push to GitHub**
   - Push your cleaned repository to GitHub
   - Use `git push origin main --force` after running the git history cleaning script
   - Set the repository to public in GitHub settings

## ðŸ“‹ Regular Security Maintenance

1. **Regular Key Rotation**
   - Rotate your Supabase API keys regularly (every 30-90 days)
   - Update deployed applications after rotation

2. **Dependency Updates**
   - Regularly update dependencies to fix security vulnerabilities
   - Run `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to check for vulnerabilities

3. **Access Reviews**
   - Regularly review who has access to your Supabase project
   - Remove access for team members who no longer need it

4. **Database Backups**
   - Set up regular database backups
   - Test restoration process periodically
