## ðŸ“‹ Regular Security Maintenance

1. **Regular Key Rotation**
   - Rotate your Supabase API keys regularly (every 30-90 days)
   - Update deployed applications after rotation
   - Follow the guide in `rotate_supabase_keys.md`

2. **Dependency Updates**
   - Regularly update dependencies to fix security vulnerabilities
   - Run `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to check for vulnerabilities

3. **Access Reviews**
   - Regularly review who has access to your Supabase project
   - Remove access for team members who no longer need it

4. **Database Backups**
   - Set up regular database backups
   - Test restoration process periodically

5. **Security Scans**
   - Periodically run security scans on your codebase
   - Run this command to check for potential credential leaks:
     `grep -r --include="*.{js,ts,tsx,md,sql,json,yaml,yml}" "password\|token\|key\|secret" --exclude-dir=node_modules .`
