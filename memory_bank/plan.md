# Project Plan: Football Stats App

## 1. Project Goal
To develop a comprehensive football statistics application that allows users to track, analyze, and visualize player and team performance data.

## 2. Key Features
- User authentication and authorization.
- Data import for matches, players, and teams.
- Player statistics tracking (goals, assists, etc.).
- Team performance analysis.
- Leaderboards and rankings.
- Data visualization (charts, graphs).
- Admin panel for data management.

## 3. Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React, TypeScript)
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL for BaaS)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## 4. Development Phases

### Current Status Assessment (as of July 16, 2025)
The project is well past Phase 1 and is actively developing features across Phases 2, 3, 4, and 5. The core data model and basic infrastructure are in place, and development is progressing on various UI and backend functionalities.

### Phase 1: Setup and Core Data Model (Largely Complete)
- **Initialize Next.js project:** Complete. Project structure and `package.json` confirm Next.js setup.
- **Set up Supabase database and authentication:** Complete. `@supabase/supabase-js` is integrated, and `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` is configured.
- **Define database schema for players, teams, matches, and stats:** Complete. `src/types/database.ts` defines key interfaces, and `sql/setup/complete_database_setup.sql` exists for schema creation.
- **Implement basic data import functionality:** Complete. Scripts (`import-historical-data.ts`, etc.) and CSV templates (`public/api/templates`) are in place.

### Phase 2: Player and Team Management (Underway)
- **Develop UI for adding/editing players and teams:** In progress. Directories like `src/app/players` and `src/app/teams` exist, indicating UI development.
- **Implement player and team profile pages:** In progress, implied by UI directories.
- **Integrate with Supabase for CRUD operations:** In progress, as a natural extension of UI development.

### Phase 3: Match Data and Statistics (Underway)
- **Create UI for entering match results and player statistics:** In progress. `src/app/matches` directory suggests ongoing work.
- **Develop functions to calculate aggregated player and team stats:** In progress. SQL functions in `sql/functions` and `sql/fixes` (e.g., `fix_team_impact_function.sql`) are being developed/refined.
- **Implement leaderboards:** Started. `sql/optimizations/leaderboard_optimizations.sql` indicates initial work.

### Phase 4: Data Visualization and Analytics (Started)
- **Integrate charting library (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts):** Started. Both libraries are in `package.json`, and `src/components/Charts` exists.
- **Create dashboards for visualizing key metrics:** Started. `src/app/analytics` suggests an analytics section is being built.
- **Implement advanced analytics features:** To be started/early stages.

### Phase 5: Admin and Deployment (Started)
- **Build out the admin panel for data oversight:** In progress. `src/app/admin` and `src/components/Admin` directories are present.
- **Implement user roles and permissions:** To be started/early stages.
- **Prepare for production deployment on Vercel:** Started. `vercel.json` is configured.

## 5. Future Enhancements
- Live match tracking.
- Advanced predictive analytics.
- User-customizable dashboards.
- Mobile application.

## 6. Communication and Collaboration
- Regular stand-up meetings.
- Use Git for version control.
- Document all major decisions and changes.
